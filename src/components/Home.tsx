          <p>
            Born and raised in Toulouse, France, I'm an 19 years old enthusiast spending her free time writing pieces
            of software, always with a cup of coffee and my cookies nearby. {/* You can give a look to the projects I'm
            working on <a href='/projects'>here</a>. */}
          </p>
          <p>
            I write most of my code in JavaScript (mostly TypeScript actually), and the rest in Rust when I need
            speedy code or when I want/need to end up with a single-file executable. {/* If you want more details about
            my skill-set, you can still give a look to my <a href='/resume'>resume</a>. */}
          </p>
          <p>
            I go by the pronouns of she/her.
